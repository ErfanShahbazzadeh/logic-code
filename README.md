A practice project for university
This is a Python class that extends the built-in `list` type, adding custom methods for inserting, deleting, searching, and displaying list elements with added flexibility.


## Features

The `Custom_list` class provides several functions:


1.**Initialize** - You can Initialize a list by using this function like how it's used in the test case.
2. **Insert** - Inserts an element at a specified index in the list.
3. **Delete_by_value** - Deletes all of the exsisting specified value in the list.
4. **Delete_by_index** - Deletes the element at a specified index.
5. **Display** - Custom display method that prints elements in a formatted way.
6. **Append** - Appends an element to the end of the list.
7. **Reverse** - A function to reverse any given list in place.
8. **Search_by_value** - Searches for all occurrence of a specified value in the list and returns its indexes.
9. **resize** - This function make sure that the list has the correct size when being changed.
